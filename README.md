## Project Overview

This project is a practical guide to NGINX, the high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. Through practical example and hands-on scenario.

## Introduction

NGINX plays a pivotal role in modern web infrastructure by efficiently handling static content, optimizing application delivery, and improving traffic distribution.


- **Basic NGINX Server Setup**: Begin by installing NGINX on your system and setting up a foundational server configuration. This forms the cornerstone for understanding NGINX's core components.

- **Reverse Proxy Configuration**: Explore the configuration of NGINX as a reverse proxy, efficiently forwarding incoming requests to backend application servers. This optimization is key to enhancing web application performance.

- **Load Balancing Setup**: Delve into the world of load balancing using NGINX to evenly distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers. Load balancing not only boosts reliability but also optimizes resource utilization.


- **Example Virtual Host Configurations**: Understand the intricacies of setting up virtual hosts in NGINX to host multiple websites on a single server. This is particularly valuable for web hosting environments.
